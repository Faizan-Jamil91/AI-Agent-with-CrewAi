AI-Driven Content Creation System
This project demonstrates the use of AI agents to automate the research and writing process for creating engaging and factually accurate articles using CrewAI.

Project Overview
The project consists of three AI agents, each with distinct roles and responsibilities:

Content Planner Agent: Develops a comprehensive content plan.
Content Writer Agent: Crafts a compelling blog post based on the content plan.
Editor Agent: Reviews and finalizes the blog post for publication.
Project Workflow
Planning: The Content Planner Agent collects information, prioritizes trends, identifies the target audience, and creates a detailed content outline with SEO keywords.
Writing: The Content Writer Agent uses the content plan to write a well-structured blog post, incorporating SEO keywords and ensuring grammatical accuracy.
Editing: The Editor Agent reviews the blog post for alignment with journalistic best practices and the organization's voice, ensuring the final output is ready for publication.
